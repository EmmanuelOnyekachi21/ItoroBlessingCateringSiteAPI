"""
Models for managing individual dishes and related entities on the food site.

This module defines the following models:
- ExtraCategory: Represents a category for extra items that can be\
    added to dishes
- ExtraItem: Represents an individual extra item, linked to an ExtraCategory.
- Dish: Represents a food item listed on the platform,
    including metadata such as name, slug, description, price, availability,
    timestamps, and the category it belongs to.
    Also supports suggested pairings, allowed extras, and image uploads.

Each model includes relevant fields and string representations.
The Dish model auto-generates\
    a slug from the name if not provided.
