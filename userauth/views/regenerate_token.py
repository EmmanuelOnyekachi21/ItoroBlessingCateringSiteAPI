def regenerate_token(request):
    """
    Handles the regeneration of a verification token for a user. This function
    accepts an email address from the request data, validates the email to
    ensure it belongs to a registered user, and checks if the account is
    already verified. If the account is not verified, it generates a new
    verification token, logs the token generation, and sends the token to the
    user's email address.

    Args:
        request (Request): The HTTP request object containing the email in the
            request data.

    Returns:
        Response: A Response object with an appropriate message and HTTP status
            code:
            - 400 BAD REQUEST if the email is not provided or the account is
              already verified.
            - 404 NOT FOUND if the email is not associated with any registered
              account.
            - 200 OK if a new verification token is successfully generated and
              sent.

    Raises:
        Account.DoesNotExist: If no account is found with the provided email.

    Side Effects:
        - Generates a new verification token for the user.
        - Sends a verification email to the user's email address.
        - Logs the token generation for auditing purposes.
